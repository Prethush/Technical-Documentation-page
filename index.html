                    <p>Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.</p>
                    <p>Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.</p>

                    <p>James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991. Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time.[24] The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. </p>
                    <p>Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, the coffee from Indonesia. Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar.</p>
                    <p>Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1996. It promised Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA) functionality, providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms. Fairly secure and featuring configurable security, it allowed network- and file-access restrictions. Major web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run Java applets within web pages, and Java quickly became popular. </p>

                    <p>Sun has defined and supports four editions of Java targeting different application environments and segmented many of its APIs so that they belong to one of the platforms. The platforms are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Java Card for smart-cards.</li>
                        <li>Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME) – targeting environments with limited resources.</li>
                        <li>Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) – targeting workstation environments.</li>
                        <li>Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) – targeting large distributed enterprise or Internet environments.</li>
                    
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>The classes in the Java APIs are organized into separate groups called packages. Each package contains a set of related interfaces, classes, subpackages and exceptions.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>The syntax of Java is largely influenced by C++ and C. Unlike C++, which combines the syntax for structured, generic, and object-oriented programming, Java was built almost exclusively as an object-oriented language.[18] All code is written inside classes, and every data item is an object, with the exception of the primitive data types, </p>
                    <code>public class HelloWorldApp {</code>
                        <code>public static void</code>
                        <code>main(String[] args) {</code>
                            <code>System.out.println("Hello World!"); // Prints the string to the console.</code>
                            <code>}</code>
                            <code>}</code>

                                <p>The Java Class Library is the standard library, developed to support application development in Java. It is controlled by Oracle in cooperation with others through the Java Community Process program.Companies or individuals participating in this process can influence the design and development of the APIs. This process has been a subject of controversy during the 2010s.[70] The class library contains features such as:</p>
